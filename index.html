                During my time at the university, I have taken a range of courses that have equipped me with a solid foundation in computer science. Some of the notable courses I have completed include CS 100, CS 101, CS 121, CS 200, CS 201, CS 300, and CS 301. These courses have provided me with a deep understanding of various aspects of computer science, including data structures, algorithms, software design, and digital logic.
                
                In addition to my academic pursuits, I have actively engaged in extracurricular activities and organizations. I am a member of the Computer Science Honor Society, Mu Alpha Theta Math Honor Society, and the Science Honor Society. These memberships have allowed me to collaborate with like-minded individuals and expand my knowledge beyond the classroom.
                
                I have gained practical experience through my employment as an App Developer/Media Intern at Dallas Plastic Surgery Institute in Dallas, TX. During my time there, I developed an iPhone application that streamlined the organization of the plastic surgery procedure catalog. I collaborated with a cross-functional team, including a plastic surgeon and Social Media Manager, to incorporate their design inputs. Additionally, I designed marketing and educational material to make procedure information more accessible to patients.
                
                As part of my academic journey, I have also worked on various projects that demonstrate my technical skills and problem-solving abilities. One notable project is "The Plastic Surgery Guide," an iPhone app developed using Swift, Firebase, and Glitch backend. This app serves as a valuable teaching tool, providing prospective patients with information on procedures and up-to-date news. I implemented features such as procedure browsing, filtering, and in-app consultation booking to enhance user experience and efficiency.
                
                Throughout my academic career, I have been recognized for my achievements and contributions. I am a member of the Sigma Alpha Lambda Honor Society at the University of Alabama, which acknowledges academic excellence and leadership involvement in the university's Greek community. Additionally, I have been honored as an AP Scholar with Distinction by the College Board for my outstanding performance on multiple AP exams.
                
                In terms of skills, I am proficient in languages such as C++, C, Java, Swift, and Python. I have a strong understanding of object-oriented programming (OOP) principles and have worked with technologies such as GitHub, Eclipse, VScode, XCode, and Microsoft Office. My engineering skills include Quartus Prime, circuit design, and data analysis.
                
                Outside of academics, I actively participate in campus activities and organizations. I have served as the Homecoming Coordinator for Alpha Delta Pi, where I contributed to a 96 sq. ft. art piece for a competition and managed a team of over 400 students for the homecoming event.
